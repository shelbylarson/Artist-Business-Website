	This website is a website I created for a friend of mine named Matthew who is a local artist here in Jackson. I think it is beneficial to have a 
website for your business because it expands your client base to anyone who has access to the internet and wants to purchase artwork. Also, for an artist,
it is helpful to have a website that showcases your work so that other people can enjoy what you've worked so hard on. 
	On the home page, there is a brief greeting and a photo which is responsive, just like the rest of the site. The menu buttons change their appearance
when you hover over them. In the footer on every page is a logo that I designed for this website. The About page is simply a page that includes information
about the artist. The Gallery page includes photos of Matthew's artwork. When you hover over the pictues, they expand to a rectangular shape and the color of
the border changes. On the References page, there is a responsive table with contact information to speak with Matthew's references.The Contact the Artist 
page includes a responsive form that can be used to contact the artist. Finally, the Services and Prices page has an interactive table which reveals the
price of the items when you hover over them.
